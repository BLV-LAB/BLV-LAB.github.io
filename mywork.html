										<p class="card-text">Foot-and-mouth-disease (FMD) is one of the most important infectious diseases of domestic animals. It is highly contagious and has the ability to infect all cloven-hoofed animals including domestic livestock (e.g. sheep, cattle, pig) and various wildlife species. FMD outbreaks have caused severe economic consequences, for example, around £8 billion was spent on controlling the disease in the UK in 2001 (Perry. 2007).<br><br>
										FMD is caused by foot-and-mouth-disease virus (FMDV), a positive strand RNA virus that belongs to the Aphthovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. Up to now, seven serotypes of FMDV (type O, A, C, SAT1, SAT2, SAT3 and Asia 1) have been identified, along with numerous subtypes that fall into these categories. The complex nature of FMDV make disease control and prevention challenging: there isn’t any vaccination available that could provide long-lasting protection against all serotypes of FMDV. <br><br>
										With the development of genomic technology, gene-editing may provide an alternative solution to FMD prevention. Our lab aims to identify and knock-out pro-viral genes that affects FMDV replication, ultimately generate FMD-resistant pigs using CRISPR/cas9 gene editing.

										<div class="card-body" style="padding-left: 100px;padding-right: 100px;">
											<p>The host range of FMDV covers most members of Arteriodactyla. Domestic farm livestock including cattle sheep and pigs are particularly vulnerable to FMD infection.

											</figure>
											The water buffaloes, commonly involved in agricultural activities in Asia, may also be infected and can pass the disease to other livestock. Some wild animals (e.g. African buffaloes and impalas) are carriers of FMDV and may contribute to the natural epidemiology of FMD when they come in contact with susceptible livestock. <br><br>
											Clinal symptoms of FMD typically include fever, reduced appetite, development of severe vesicular disease and abortion in adult animal. Death is often associated with young animals.

										<h4 style="padding-left: 50px;">Transmission</h4>
									</div>										
										<div class="card-body" style="padding-left: 100px;padding-right: 100px;">
											<p>FMDV can be transmitted by having direct contact with infected animals or indirect contact with contaminated products. The most common route for transmission is through the exchange of droplet nuclei (aerosol) between animals. Aerosol excreted by infected animals can be inhaled by recipients and be deposited in their respiratory tract. 
											Indirect contact with contaminated animal products or tools is another important mean of transmission pathway. Virus may be contained in milk or meat products that are frozen and transported, therefore facilitate the spread of FMD to distant area. For this reason, the export and trading of animal products from FMDV endemic country are banned by law, which cause great economic loss to the country (OIE, FAO. 2012).

										<h4 style="padding-left: 50px;">Current methods to control FMD</h4>
									</div>		
										<div class="card-body" style="padding-left: 100px;padding-right: 100px;">
											<p>Different options are available to countries that suffer from FMD outbreak, depending on their trading status: <br><br>
											For FMD-endemic countries, vaccination and movement restriction are the main control methods. However, the current serotype-specific vaccine will not provide protection against other serotypes and subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of live-attenuated vaccine and the rapid mutation rates in virus make the vaccine protection short-lasting and can only last for approximately 6 months. This means that vaccination to animals is required twice a year, and that the cost for farming significantly increases.<br><br> 
											For previously FMD-free countries such as countries in Europe, they also have the option to use vaccines at a price, meaning that they would have to give up their trading status for animal products. Therefore, culling of infected animals is most often employed, which causes catastrophic economic losses (OIE, FAO., 2012).

									<div class="card-body" style="padding-left: 100px;padding-right: 100px;">
										
										<p>Genome scale siRNA knock-down screen was performed previously by the Haas group in order to identify novel genes that may be associated with FMDV replication. 53 human genes were identified and are proposed to either enhance or inhibit the viral replication, however, further confirmation in porcine cells is needed.<br>
												In this project, 4 genes that showed pro-viral activities in the screening were selected to generate porcine cell lines with genetic knock-out using CRISPR/Cas 9 gene-editing. The ultimate goal of the project is to generate FMDV resistant pigs.

												  <figcaption class="figure-caption">image from <a href="https://www.synthego.com/learn/crispr">Synthego</a></figcaption>
												</figure>
												<br><br>
												The 4 genes are:<br>
												Plasminogen activator tissue type (PLAT)<br>
												Mannose receptor C type 2 (MRC2)<br>
												Hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2 (HAVCR2)<br>
												Caveolin 3(CAV3)<br><br>

												By the end of the project, cell lines with PLAT knock-out were successfully generated and were tested. Although PLAT appear to have a pro-viral effect on FMDV replication,  further confirmation is required.
